## UI Redesign Goals

- **Dashboard Overhaul**: Clean, action-focused layout with upload options, new account entry, and personalized to-do boxes for placements.
- **Streamlined Navigation**: Redesigned pages for intuitive use â€” no scrolling, max two clicks to access placement details.
- **Simplified Account Listing and Submission**: Make the process of accessing accounts easier. Core fields only, flexible uploads for broker/PM forms.
- **Unified Document & Status Management**: Centralized matrix for updating statuses, SLAs, and remarks with Excel-like efficiency.
